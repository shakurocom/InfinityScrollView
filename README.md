Task Manager is a Swift library designed to manage asynchronous operations. The main purpose of the Task Manager component is to encapsulate work with the server, database, and other background operations into unit-like operations or tasks. This helps to separate business logic from UI and reuse operations across the app.

## Requirements

- iOS 11.0+
- Xcode 11.0+
- Swift 5.0+

## Installation

### CocoaPods

To integrate Infinity Scroll View into your Xcode project with CocoaPods, specify it in your `Podfile`:

```ruby
pod 'Shakuro.InfinityScrollView'
```

Then, run the following command:

```bash
$ pod install
```

### Manually

If you prefer not to use CocoaPods, you can integrate Shakuro.InfinityScrollView simply by copying it to your project.

## Usage

1. Create a couple of operations by subclassing `BaseOperation`. An operation should be a complete and independent unit of business logic. 
2. Subclass `TaskManager` and override `.willPerformOperation()`. Define dependencies between operations in this method. Itâ€™s a good idea to create two separate `TaskManager` objects/subclasses: one to handle auth-related tasks and the second one for all other work.
3. Start your tasks by calling `.performOperation()` or `.performGroup()` on `TaskManager`. You can use completions  to handle results.

Have a look at the [InfinityScrollView_Example](https://github.com/shakurocom/InfinityScrollView/tree/main/InfinityScrollView_Example)

### Important notes

An operation should have `operationHash` defined if its work rely only on its options. Hash is used in `.willPerformOperation()` to construct dependencies.

Carefully consider the dependencies between operations. `.willPerformOperation()` should return an already existing in the queue (old) operation instead of a new one if both operations (old & new) are equal from the business logic perspective. This will result in only single operation being executed with multiple completion callbacks.

Each task (an operation or a group of operations) can have a `retryHandler` to perform a retry under specified conditions. It is a perfect tool if you are dealing with an unreliable server.

Usual flow: Interactor -> Options -> Task Manager (operations + dependencies inside) -> HTTP Client + Database -> Retry if error (for example session expired error) -> Completion block inside Interactor with typed result.
